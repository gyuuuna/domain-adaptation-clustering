# Sentence Embedding Adaptation
This repository contains the source code for an experiment conducted in the field of computer science and natural language processing (NLP). The goal of the experiment is to explore the applicability of domain adaptation for clustering (topic modeling) by adapting a dataset from a specific domain.

## Experiment Overview
The experiment involves performing domain adaptation on a dataset to enable clustering (topic modeling) within a specific domain. The following steps were followed:

1. Dataset Selection:
- OCTIS: The OCTIS framework was used for dataset preprocessing.
    - Health News in Twitter: A dataset related to health news on Twitter, which can be loaded using OCTIS.
- Topic Modeling for Research Articles: A dataset containing research articles for topic modeling, contributed by Abishek Sudarshan.

2. Domain Adaptation:
- A Simple Method for Domain Adaptation of Sentence Embeddings
3. Clustering & Text Segmentation:
- UMAP: The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm was used for dimensionality reduction
- Unsupervised Clustering: Various unsupervised clustering algorithms were employed, including agglomerative clustering, divisive clustering, k-means, and DBSCAN (HDBSCAN).
